I am Ji Xinyou, currently a graduate student of MSCS at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I received my B.Eng degree in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I love building cloud-native computer systems, watching StarWars series and eating Tacos. (Recently loving chipotle's bowl)
